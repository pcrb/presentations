Proposed Topics
================

A collected list of topics that have been proposed for presentation.

* Using a "depends-on" jQuery plugin to hide/show HTML elements based on values in a form. [James]
* Handling slow report generation with long-polling AJAX requests and background processing. [James]
* Implementing a JavaScript inclusion framework for providing common functionality across multiple apps in a configurable way. [Jeremy]
* A hack to make files uploaded via paperclip be retained (not needing to be re-uploaded) in case of a validation error elsewhere on the form. [Jeremy]
* Real life use cases for some favorite design patterns. (This could be several small presentations.) [Jeremy]
* Sortable table rows (ajax and form based as appropriate based on use case) using jquery-ui/sortable and ranked-model. [Jeremy]
